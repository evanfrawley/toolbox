A compilation of useful resources, links, and shortcuts for learning web development.

### 0. Getting Started
So you want to learn how to do web development? Well, you've (hopefully) come to the right place! Let's jump right in.

#### Your Machine & Necessary Software

###### Pick a solid text editor

Text editors is where you'll be spending most of your time doing the heavy lifting for your code. This is where the actual magic happens. Any of the below listed editors are fantastic and use by millions of developers around the world. Each also have addons & extensions that you can get to augment their initial functionality!

1. [Atom](https://atom.io) - made by Github
2. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - made by Microsoft

> :bulb: If you wanted to get a bit fancy, you could check out [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). They have student licenses that you can get for free!

###### Understanding the Command Line

The command line is one of the most powerful tools that you'll have at your disposal while being a developer. Interacting with your machine and your files at a low level is powerful, and you can do alot of neat stuff inside a command line!

Let's break this out into operating systems!

1. Unix based (Mac OSX & Linux). [Unix based machines](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unix) are pretty neat and use a [shell](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unix_shell) to interact with the files on a computer in an intimate, low level way. TLDR: You can do cool stuff in the shell that would take hours, days, weeks, to do by hand.
  * OSX - Terminal
    * What the heck is the terminal? (Here's an article that talks a little about it)[http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/].
  * Linux - Command line interface (CLI)
    * What is a CLI? [Here's a quick article explaining what it is](https://www.linux.com/learn/how-use-linux-command-line-basics-cli).

2. Windows based. Windows is kinda crappy in that its command line interface (CLI) isn't very good or user friendly. Therefore, to get a good CLI, you have a couple options!
  * [Gitbash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) - Recommended
  * [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
